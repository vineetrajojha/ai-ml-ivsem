pseudocode for an algotrithm to find number of connected components in a graph:

G = (V, E) where G = Graph, V = Vertices and E =  Edges

// BFS pseudocode:

function BFS(V, E)
    mark each node in V with 0
    count <- 0, init(queue)
    for each vertex in V do
        if vertex is marked 0 then
            count <- count + 1
            mark vertex with count
            push(queue, vertex)
            while queue is non-empty do
            u <- pop(queue)
            for each edge (u, w) adjacent to 'u' do
                if 'w' is marked with 0 then
                    count <- count + 1
                    mark 'w' with count
                    enqueue(queue, w)


// DFS pseudocode

function DFS (V, E)
    mark each node in V with 0
    count <- 0
    for each vertex in V do
        if vertex is marked then    
            DFSexplore(vertex)

function DFSexplore(vertex)
    count <- count + 1
    mark vertex with count
    for each edge (vertex, next) do
        if 'next' is marked with 0 then
            DFSexplore(next)
